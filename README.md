# The C Programming Language

In 1978, *The C Programming Language*—authored by Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie—was published, offering a clear and authoritative introduction to C, a language developed earlier in the 1970s. A decade later, C was standardized as ANSI C, enhancing its portability and ensuring consistent behavior not only on *UNIX* but also across diverse systems.

Since then, C has continued to evolve through multiple revisions, inspiring the design and syntax of many modern programming languages, including Python, Java, and JavaScript. Despite the emergence of challengers, C remains a cornerstone for understanding the fundamentals of programming and the workings of computer at a low level.

The book, often regarded as the "bible" of programming, provides timeless insights into the principles of software design as well as a guide to C. Revisiting this book allows us to trace the roots of modern programming, exploring how fundamental concepts introduced by C continue to influence contemporary languages and deepen our understanding of computation at its core.
